                                <h4>Background</h4> <p>I designed a mobile app interface in Figma to promote the Chamarel brand, focusing on a user-friendly and visually appealing experience. The design incorporates a pastel color palette to reflect the natural and serene identity of Chamarel, with earthy tones like beige and green symbolizing the connection to nature. I emphasized clean navigation, intuitive layouts, and a welcoming aesthetic to enhance usability and engagement. This project showcases my ability to blend visual storytelling with practical user experience principles to effectively communicate a brand's essence through mobile design.

                                    <h4>Objectives </h4> <p>  The main objective of the Chamarel UI/UX design project was to create a digital experience that promotes eco-tourism while reflecting the natural charm of Chamarel. The design aims to highlight the village’s rich culture, scenic beauty, and sustainable travel opportunities through a nature-inspired aesthetic using soft pastel tones and earthy colors. A key focus was placed on delivering a seamless user experience with intuitive navigation and clear user flows, making it easy for users to explore local attractions and book activities. Additionally, the project seeks to encourage engagement with the local community by showcasing cultural elements and supporting environmentally conscious tourism.</p>

                                    <h4>Design Process </h4> <p>  The design process for the Chamarel project followed a user-centered approach, beginning with the development of user personas based on potential visitors interested in nature, culture, and eco-tourism. </p>
                                </div >
                                <div>
                                <p>These personas helped define user needs, motivations, and pain points, which guided the design direction. Following this, I created a detailed user journey map to visualize how users would interact with the platform from discovery to booking. This allowed me to identify key touchpoints and ensure a smooth, engaging experience. </p>
                            </div>

                            <p>With this foundation, I developed low-fidelity wireframes to plan the layout and structure of the app, focusing on usability and clear information hierarchy. These wireframes were then refined into high-fidelity mockups, bringing together functionality and aesthetics aligned with the project's goals.</p>

                                    <h4>Low Fidelity wireframes, User jourey & Personas </h4> <p>  The design process began with creating lo-fi wireframes, personas and journey map to map out the structure and flow of the site. These wireframes served as the blueprint for the design, outlining the placement of key elements such as the navigation menu, content sections, and interactive features. Lo-fi wireframes focused on basic layout and functionality, providing a clear vision of how users would interact with the site. </p>

                                <h4>Background</h4> <p>"Anime Realm" is a blog site meticulously designed on Figma, aiming to celebrate and explore the vast and diverse world of anime. As a passionate fan of anime, I have envisioned this platform to serve as a hub where enthusiasts can gather to discuss their favorite shows, delve into anime music, and engage with the broader anime community. This report will detail the purpose, features, and design choices behind "Anime Realm" and explain why I chose to create this website.

                                    <h4>Objectives </h4> <p>  The primary objective of "Anime Realm" is to create a comprehensive and engaging platform for anime fans. The website serves multiple purposes. Firstly, it aims to inform by providing detailed reviews, analyses, and recommendations of various anime series and movies. By doing so, it helps fans discover new content and gain deeper insights into their favorite shows. Secondly, "Anime Realm" seeks to connect fans by fostering a sense of community through discussions, forums, and social interactions. This aspect is crucial in creating a space where fans can share their thoughts, experiences, and fandom. Lastly, the site aims to entertain by offering interesting articles, fun quizzes, and captivating content that keeps users engaged and entertained.</p>

                                    <h4>Design Process </h4> <p>  The design process for "Anime Realm" began with extensive research and planning. I started by identifying the core objectives and target audience for the site. This involved understanding what anime fans look for in a blog and community site, including their preferences for content and design. After establishing the objectives, I created wireframes to map out the structure and flow of the site. These wireframes served as the blueprint for the design, outlining the placement of key elements such as the navigation menu, content sections, and interactive features.</p>
                                </div >

                                <p>Once the wireframes were finalized, I moved on to creating the visual design in Figma. The color palette, inspired by the vibrant and fantastical worlds of anime, was carefully selected to evoke a sense of wonder and excitement. The primary colors include deep purples, bright pinks, and soft blues, which together create a visually appealing and cohesive look. I then designed individual components such as buttons, icons, and illustrations, ensuring they aligned with the overall theme and enhanced the user experience.</p>
                            </div>
                           
                                <p>Throughout the design process, I incorporated feedback from fellow anime fans to refine and improve the site. This iterative approach allowed me to make adjustments based on user preferences and ensure that the final design resonated with the target audience. The result is a visually striking and user-friendly website that effectively captures the essence of anime culture and provides a welcoming space for fans to connect and engage.</p>
